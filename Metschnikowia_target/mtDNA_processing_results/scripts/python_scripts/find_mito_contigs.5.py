##V5 updates
#Significant overhaul
#Now uses blast outfmt 6 tabular output with the following field layout
#qseqid sseqid qcovs pident evalue score qstart qend sstart send

#added os.path functionalities to improve outFileName generation
#changed outFileName to be same as infile but ending with "cov_filtered.tab"


##V4.1 changes
#changed output to ".tab" and removed gff related info

##V4 Changes
#moved blast search to separate script blastSearch.1.py

##V3 change notes
#restructured coverage cutoff
#results are now compared to the sum coverage of all individual hsps in an alignment
#for which the coverage of the hsp was at least 5%
#I removed sequence reporting to accomodate this change

##V2 change notes
#The coverage cutoff is now taken in as a command line input
#to allow this same script to be run flexibly for different searches


##V1.3 change notes
#Changed blast settings to be more conservative (word size from 7 to 16)
